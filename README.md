### Improving Deep Neural Networks 
### Objectives: 
- Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization
### Specific Objectives
  - Recall that different types of initializations lead to different results
  - Setting up Machine Learning Application: train/dev/test sets
  - Diagnose the bias and variance issues in DL models : bias-variance trade-off
  - Regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.
  - Deal with experimental issues such as Vanishing gradients in DL models
  - Recall various optimization methods such as Momentum, RMSProp,(Stochastic) Gradient Descent (SGD), and Adam
  - Use random minibatches to accelerate the convergence and improve optimization
  - Use gradient checking to verify the correctness of backpropagation implementation
